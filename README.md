In order to set up the site you will need to add the .env to the backend and frontend with the following info.

Frontend:
VITE_SERVER_URL='http://localhost:1011/api/v1'

Backend:
PORT=1011
WEATHER_API_KEY='6eef91e41fb94946ad7150055240508'

---------------------------------------------------

I have added to the site the functionality to switch the weather from celsius to fahrenheit by clicking the c/f button at the top. 
---
can press the clear button to reset the current weather and clear input.
---
added toasters in a case of an error and success.
